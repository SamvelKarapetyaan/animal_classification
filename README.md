# Animal Classification

  We are creating a neural network to classify 10 types of animals. Our training dataset is sourced from Kaggle.com. We have provided a small training dataset in our repository for testing purposes. Here are the translations of the animal classes(Italian - English):

1. "cane": "dog"
2. "cavallo": "horse"
3. "elefante": "elephant"
4. "farfalla": "butterfly"
5. "gallina": "chicken"
6. "gatto": "cat"
7. "mucca": "cow"
8. "pecora": "sheep"
9. "scoiattolo": "squirrel"
10. "ragno": "spider"

We have implemented two networks for this task: one using TensorFlow and the other using PyTorch. You can choose either of them for the implementation.
